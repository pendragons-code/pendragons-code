## Hi there 👋
We shall now seek that which we shall not find.
We chase shadows in the code, echoes in the stack trace.
And yet — in each bug, a riddle; in each crash, a revelation.

“To code is to dream in logic.”

Happy Malaysian Developer Noises <3


With teh tarik in one hand and a keyboard in the other,
We brave the unknown function, the undocumented behavior,
The semicolon that got away.

May your commits be clean,
Your merges smooth,
And your Stack Overflow tabs ever open.
